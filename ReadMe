QA. write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule perodic tasks:
Answer: We can configure perodic tasks either by manually adding the module or using the django-celery -beat package.I would like to choose the django-celery-beat.because this extension enables the user to store periodic task in django database and manage the tasks using the django admin interface.When creating scalable web application, celery provides a task queue with real-time processing and task scheduling functionality, which are absent in the core django framework.celery modules periodic task functionality allows developers to automate repetitive tasks from within a django project.
    

QB. In what circumstances would you use Flask instead of Django and vice versa?
Answer:  1: Flask provides support for API while Django doesn't have any support for API.
                2: Flask is a Python web framework built for rapid development wheras Django is built for easy and simple projects.
                3: Flask offers a diversified working style while Django offers a monolithic working style.
                4: Flask is WSGI framework while Django is a full stack web framework.
                5: Flask does not support dynamic HTML pages and django offers dynamic HTML pages.
                6: URL dispatcher of the flask web framework is a RESTful request on the other hand, URL dispatcher of django framework is based on controller-regex
